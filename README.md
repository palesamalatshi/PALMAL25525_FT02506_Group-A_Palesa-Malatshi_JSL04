# Kanban Task Management Board

## Project Description

This is a dynamic, single-page Kanban board application created for the JSL04 challenge. The project allows users to visualize and manage their tasks in a clear, organized "To Do," "Doing," and "Done" layout. The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, emphasizing clean code, modular functions, and a responsive, user-friendly interface. A key feature is the interactive modal, which allows for viewing and editing task details on the fly.
